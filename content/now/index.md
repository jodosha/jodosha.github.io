### Job

I'm working at [Toptal](https://toptal.com) as Backend Architect. With my team, we envision and execute the SOA architecture of the company.

Currently, I'm overviewing initiatives that involve large SOA service extraction from a Ruby on Rails monolith, company public pages, and advanced usage of [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) with a [Apollo Federation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/federation/introduction/).

### Open Source

**Hanami 2.0** looks great, we count to release a new alpha during Q1 2021.

**Hanami 1.0** reached to its technological end, as we're locked to old dependencies that prevent us to support Ruby 3 on Hanami 1.0.

**dry-rb** `dry-cli` and `dry-inflector` gems are pretty stable. No groundbreaking changes there.

### Personal

Medidation and Personal OKR experiments didn't work.

I've got a really small annual agenda where I wrote on broad personal and professional goals for 2021.
From there I go to monthly goals and then weekly ones.
Each day I jot down a few notes regarding the day.

I'm learning how to ~~techno~~ electronic music.
The learning process is made of discovery, limiting to a single genre doesn't allow a 360 growth.

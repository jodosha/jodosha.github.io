### Lockdown

Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, which is serious in Italy, I'm in lockdown for the third week in a row.
My family, friends, relatives & I are doing well. I'm really greateful for that.

If you want me to do **remote presentations / Q&A** about Ruby, [Hanami](https://hanamirb.org), remote work, software, DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jodosha).

### Job

I'm working at [Toptal](https://toptal.com) as Back-end Architect to envision a SOA architecture for the company.

Currently, I'm overviewing initiatives that involve [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) and advanced usage of [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) with a [Apollo Federation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/federation/introduction/).

### Open Source

I'm working on **Hanami 2.0** and the new **Hanami::API**.

The Hanami, [ROM](https://rom-rb.org/), and [dry-rb](https://dry-rb.org/) teams joined the efforts to deliver **together** Hanami 2.0.

### Personal

I'm metidating again (using [Calm](https://www.calm.com/) app).

Wrapping up the first quarter using [OKRs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OKR) to track both professional and personal goals.
The outcome are decent. From other people's experience, it will take a few quarters to adapt to the system.

I'm learning how to techno music.
